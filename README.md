# VisualStudioDemos
A few of my favorite web apps from programming with Bob Tabor at learnvisualstudio.net

April/May 2017

These are a few of the challenges I wrote when learning ASP.NET, C#, and Visual Studio with Bob Tabor.

## Days Between Dates Challenge:
Select two dates on two separate calendars, the progam calculates days elapsed
## Epic Spy Tracker:
Supplements the original Epic Spy challenge by tracking spy activity.
## Simple Calculator:
A very basic calculator. I improved on Bob's version by programming it to use doubles instead of integers.
